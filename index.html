        <p>Hi! my name is Krista! I'm one of seven, I fall in the middle of all the sibs. I have a huge Yours, Mine and Ours family!</p>
        <p>I used to work at vet, thats where I adopted my dog. Shes a whopping 7 pounds. In my free time I like to sleep, and go fishing.</p>
        <p>You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. </p>
    <p>You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba..
        Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. </p>
    <p>He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. </p>
    <p>I’ve got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. </p>
    <p>I’m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
        You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. </p>
